# Finite Element Method

## Description

This repository is dedicated to all the code and calculations done during the "Introduction to the Finite Element Method" lectures during the second half of 2024 at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

I must acknowledge that much of the inspiration and learning came from the repository [Elementos_Finitos](https://github.com/bacarmo/Elementos_Finitos) from [Bacarmo](https://github.com/bacarmo), which has been an invaluable resource throughout this process.

You can check out my final project at [FiniteElements2dDirichlet.jl](https://github.com/joaovictorlopezpereira/FiniteElements2dDirichlet.jl). It is a ``Julia`` package that solves a bidimensional stationary equation using the Finite Element Method. The package was officially accepted into the ``Julia`` registry in December 2024.

Any additional bibliography used is cited in the ``.pdf`` files.
