This page is dedicated to all the code and explanations written during the "Finite Elements Method" lectures during the second half of 2024 at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

I must acknowledge that much of the inspiration and learning came from the repository [Elementos_Finitos](https://github.com/bacarmo/Elementos_Finitos), from [Bacarmo](https://github.com/bacarmo) which has been an invaluable resource throughout this process.

Any additional bibliography used is cited in the pdf files.
